        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Maedeh, a 23-year-old girl who loves reading books to learn new things.
            I'm also a fan of psychology podcasts that teach me cool stuff about how people think.
            I'm curious about technology and always want to know what's new.Currently,I'm in the process of learning
            <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,and my next exciting step is to dive into the world of
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
            On February 13<sup>th</sup>,2023, I started a new journey in Canada, full of opportunities to explore and
            grow.
            I like challenges; they help me learn and get better. Whether it's solving tough problems, picking up
            new skills, or facing personal challenges, I aim to do my best and turn each experience into a lesson for
            myself.
