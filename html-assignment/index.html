            <p>
                I'm Maedeh, a 23-year-old girl who loves reading books to learn new things.
                I'm also a fan of psychology podcasts that teach me cool stuff about how people think.
                I'm curious about technology and always want to know what's new.Currently,I'm in the process of learning
                <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,and my next exciting step is to dive into the world
                of
                <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.

            <p>
                On February 13<sup>th</sup>,2023, I started a new journey in Canada, full of opportunities to explore
                and
                grow.
                I like challenges; they help me learn and get better. Whether it's solving tough problems, picking up
                new skills, or facing personal challenges, I aim to do my best and turn each experience into a lesson
                for
                myself.
            </p>
